# FuncIRC CLI (Command Line Interface) Client

## Usage
Requires the library file from the FuncIRC project to be able to interface with an IRC server.

Built on the principle of the MVU(Model-View-Update) architecture. In future versions it will probably transition into using Elmish as a library for the MVU architecture.

Can be used as a standalone library to create interactable UI in the console window.
